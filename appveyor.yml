  # Prepend newly installed Python to the PATH of this build (this cannot be
  # done from inside the powershell script as it would require to restart
  # the parent CMD process).
  - "SET PATH=%PYTHON%;%PYTHON%\\Scripts;%PATH%"

  # Check that we have the expected version and architecture for Python
  - "python --version"
  - "python -c \"import struct; print(struct.calcsize('P') * 8)\""

  # Upgrade to the latest version of pip to avoid it displaying warnings
  # about it being out of date.
  - "pip install --disable-pip-version-check --user --upgrade pip"

  # We need wheel installed to build wheels
  - "python -m pip install wheel"

after_test:
  # This step builds your wheels.
  # Again, you only need build.cmd if you're building C extensions for
  # 64-bit Python 3.3/3.4. And you need to use %PYTHON% to get the correct
  # interpreter
  - "python setup.py bdist_wheel"

artifacts:
  # bdist_wheel puts your built wheel in the dist directory
  - path: dist\*

#on_success:
#  You can use this step to upload your artifacts to a public website.
#  See Appveyor's documentation for more details. Or you can simply
#  access your wheels from the Appveyor "artifacts" tab for your build.
